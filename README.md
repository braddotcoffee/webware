# Webware

A minimal recreation of the Webware class that I took in college. This tutorial is split into two parts: **Server Side Rendering** and **Client Side Rendering**.

If you have not previously worked with version control (git) before, I highly recommend starting with the [GitHub primer](github-primer/README.md).

## Server Side Rendering

The goals of this tutorial are:

- [ ] Create simple Python servers for local development
- [ ] Build dynamic HTML via your Python server
- [ ] Serve static HTML/CSS files via your Python server
- [ ] Apply basic CSS to style your website

## Client Side Rendering

The goals of this tutorial are:

- [ ] Define a Python API that returns JSON
- [ ] Write client side JavaScript to "fetch" data from this API
- [ ] Render HTML elements based on the data retrieved
